<REVIEW>
The refactored code includes the following improvements:

1. Corrected the shebang line: Changed from "!#/bin/bash" to "#!/bin/bash".

2. Added a variable for the error message: This makes it easier to modify the message in the future and improves code readability.

3. Added a check for the espeak command: The code now checks if espeak is installed before trying to use it. If it's not available, it falls back to printing the message to the console.

4. Improved comments: The comment now accurately reflects that the sound is for an error alert, not a screenshot.

5. Added error handling: If espeak is not installed, the user is informed and the error message is still displayed in the console.

These changes make the script more robust, informative, and easier to maintain. The script will now work even if espeak is not installed, providing a better user experience.
