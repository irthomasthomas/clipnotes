<REVIEW>
The refactored code includes several improvements:

1. Added a shebang line that uses `/usr/bin/env bash` for better portability.

2. Added `set -euo pipefail` to enable stricter error handling and exit on errors.

3. Defined constants for state names to avoid magic strings and improve maintainability.

4. Created functions for common operations:
   - `show_notification`: Displays a notification using kdialog.
   - `get_clipboard_content`: Retrieves content from the clipboard.
   - `set_clipboard_content`: Sets content to the clipboard.

5. Used `touch` instead of `echo ""` to create an empty file, which is more idiomatic.

6. Replaced `[ ]` with `[[ ]]` for better compatibility and functionality in Bash.

7. Used `$()` instead of backticks for command substitution, which is more readable and nestable.

8. Improved variable quoting to prevent word splitting and globbing.

These changes make the script more readable, maintainable, and robust. The functionality remains the same, but the code is now more organized and follows better bash scripting practices.
