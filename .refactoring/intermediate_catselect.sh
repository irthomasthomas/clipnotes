Here's my review and refactored code based on the provided content:

<REVIEW>
The given code implements a Selection Stitcher program that monitors clipboard changes and combines two consecutive selections. It also includes unit tests for the functionality. The code is generally well-structured but can be improved in terms of simplicity and reducing imports. Here are some observations:

1. The code mixes the main functionality with testing in a single file.
2. It uses multiple imports that can be reduced or eliminated.
3. The notification system using tkinter might be overkill for a simple clipboard utility.
4. The main loop in the `run` method could be simplified.
5. The unittest part can be separated or removed if not needed in the main program.

In the refactored version, I'll focus on simplifying the code, reducing imports, and merging the functionality into a single Python file without the test suite.

import time
import pyperclip

class SelectionStitcher:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = "IDLE"
        self.first_selection = ""

    def show_notification(self, message):
        print(f"Selection Stitcher: {message}")

    def run(self):
        last_clipboard_content = pyperclip.paste()

        try:
            while True:
                current_clipboard_content = pyperclip.paste()

                if current_clipboard_content != last_clipboard_content:
                    if self.state == "IDLE":
                        self.first_selection = current_clipboard_content
                        self.state = "FIRST_SELECTION_CAPTURED"
                        self.show_notification("First selection captured.")
                    elif self.state == "FIRST_SELECTION_CAPTURED":
                        stitched_selection = f"{self.first_selection} {current_clipboard_content}"
                        pyperclip.copy(stitched_selection)
                        self.state = "IDLE"
                        self.show_notification("Selection stitched and copied to clipboard.")

                    last_clipboard_content = current_clipboard_content

                time.sleep(0.5)
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print("Selection Stitcher: Stopped.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    stitcher = SelectionStitcher()
    stitcher.run()
</REFACTORED_CODE>

This refactored version accomplishes the following:

1. Removes the dependency on tkinter, simplifying the notification system to use print statements instead.
2. Eliminates the unittest part, focusing solely on the main functionality.
3. Reduces the number of imports to just `time` and `pyperclip`.
4. Keeps the core functionality intact while simplifying the overall structure.
5. Adds a try-except block to handle KeyboardInterrupt gracefully, allowing the user to stop the program.

The refactored code maintains the original functionality of stitching two consecutive clipboard selections while simplifying the implementation and reducing dependencies.
