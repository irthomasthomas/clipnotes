The refactored code includes the following improvements:

1. Type hints: Added type hints to improve code readability and maintainability.

2. Code organization: Broke down larger methods into smaller, more focused methods (e.g., `_stop_monitoring`, `_start_monitoring`, `_get_paper_title`, `_setup_output`).

3. Improved naming: Renamed some methods to be more descriptive (e.g., `_start_clipboard_monitoring_thread`).

4. Reduced code duplication: Extracted common functionality into separate methods (e.g., `_process_new_content`).

5. Improved error handling: Changed `exit(1)` to `sys.exit(1)` for better consistency and to ensure proper shutdown.

6. Simplified logic: Removed unnecessary else statements and simplified conditional logic where possible.

7. Consistent string formatting: Used f-strings throughout for better readability and performance.

8. Improved modularity: Separated concerns more clearly, making the code easier to maintain and extend.

9. Enhanced readability: Reorganized imports and added blank lines to improve overall code readability.

These changes make the code more maintainable, easier to read, and less prone to errors. The functionality remains the same, but the structure is improved for better long-term development and maintenance.
