<REVIEW>
The refactored code transforms the original Bash script into a Python script, which offers several improvements:

1. Improved readability and maintainability: The Python code is more structured and easier to understand, with functions for each specific task.

2. Better error handling: Python provides better mechanisms for handling errors and exceptions, which can be further improved in this code.

3. Use of tempfile module: Instead of hardcoding temporary file paths, the script now uses Python's tempfile module to get the appropriate temporary directory.

4. Modular design: The code is split into functions, making it easier to test and modify individual components.

5. Type safety: Python provides better type safety compared to Bash, reducing the risk of unexpected behavior due to type-related issues.

6. Cross-platform potential: While this script still uses Linux-specific commands (xclip, kdialog), it would be easier to make it cross-platform in Python than in Bash.

7. Potential for expansion: The Python script can be more easily expanded to include additional features or integrate with other Python libraries.

Areas for further improvement:
1. Error handling: Add try-except blocks to handle potential errors, especially when interacting with files and subprocesses.
2. Logging: Implement logging to track the script's behavior and aid in debugging.
3. Configuration: Consider using a configuration file or command-line arguments for customizable settings.
4. Testing: Add unit tests to ensure the reliability of individual functions.

Overall, this refactored version provides a more robust and maintainable solution while preserving the original functionality.
