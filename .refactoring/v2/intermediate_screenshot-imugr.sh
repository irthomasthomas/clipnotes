<REVIEW>
The refactored code improves upon the original in several ways:

1. Shebang correction: The shebang line has been corrected from "!#/bin/bash" to "#!/bin/bash".

2. Function encapsulation: The alert sound functionality has been encapsulated in a function called `play_alert_sound()`. This improves code organization and reusability.

3. Local variable: The message string is now stored in a local variable within the function, which is a good practice for containing variable scope.

4. Main execution: The function is called outside of its definition, clearly separating the function declaration from its execution.

5. Comments: The existing comment has been preserved, and an additional comment has been added to explain the function's purpose.

These changes make the script more organized, easier to read, and more maintainable. The functionality remains the same, but the structure is improved for potential future extensions or modifications.
