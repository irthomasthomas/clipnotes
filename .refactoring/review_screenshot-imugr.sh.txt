The provided code is a simple bash script that uses the 'espeak' command to play an audio message. To convert this to Python, we'll need to use a text-to-speech library. We'll use the 'pyttsx3' library, which is cross-platform and doesn't require additional dependencies like espeak.

The refactored Python code will include the functionality of the bash script and allow for easy expansion in the future if needed.
