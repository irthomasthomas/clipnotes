The provided code is a Python script that generates an abstract from the primary selection (selected text) in a Linux environment and copies it to the clipboard. It uses xclip for accessing the primary selection and pyperclip for clipboard operations. The code is well-structured and includes error handling, but it can be simplified and improved.

Key observations:
1. The code is already in Python, not bash, so no merging is required.
2. The use of subprocess to call xclip can be replaced with a pure Python solution.
3. The pyperclip library can be replaced with a more lightweight clipboard solution.
4. The argparse usage can be simplified for this small script.
5. Some functions can be combined to reduce complexity.

Improvements in the refactored version:
1. Removed dependency on xclip and subprocess by using Xlib for primary selection.
2. Replaced pyperclip with a simpler clipboard solution using Xlib.
3. Simplified the argument parsing.
4. Combined the abstract generation and clipboard copying into a single function.
5. Improved error handling and reduced the number of try-except blocks.
