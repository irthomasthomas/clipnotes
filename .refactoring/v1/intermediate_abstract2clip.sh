<REVIEW>
The refactored code improves upon the original script in several ways:

1. Shebang: Changed to `#!/usr/bin/env bash` for better portability across different systems.

2. Added `set -euo pipefail`:
   - `e`: Exits the script if any command fails.
   - `u`: Treats unset variables as an error.
   - `o pipefail`: Ensures that a pipeline returns a failure if any command in the pipeline fails.

3. Improved readability: The script now uses variables to store intermediate results, making it easier to understand the flow and debug if necessary.

4. Removed unnecessary use of pipe: Instead of piping the output of xclip directly to the fetch-abstract.sh script, we now store it in a variable first. This allows for easier debugging and potential future expansion of the script.

5. Error handling: With `set -e`, the script will now exit if any command fails, preventing potential issues from cascading.

6. Security: By using `echo "$VARIABLE"` instead of just `$VARIABLE`, we prevent potential issues with word splitting and globbing.

These changes make the script more robust, readable, and maintainable while preserving its original functionality.
