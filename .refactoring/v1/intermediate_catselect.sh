<REVIEW>
The refactored code transforms the bash script into a Python script, which offers several improvements:

1. Improved readability: The Python code is more structured and easier to understand, with functions for each main operation.

2. Better error handling: Python's built-in exception handling can be easily added to manage potential errors.

3. Cross-platform compatibility: While the original script uses Linux-specific commands, the Python version can be more easily adapted for other operating systems.

4. Easier maintenance: The modular structure of the Python code makes it easier to modify or extend functionality.

5. Use of constants: The script uses constants for file paths, making it easier to change them if needed.

6. Use of tempfile module: The refactored code uses Python's tempfile module to get the appropriate temporary directory, which is more portable across different systems.

7. Proper file handling: The Python version uses 'with' statements for file operations, ensuring that files are properly closed after use.

8. Type consistency: The Python version consistently uses string operations, avoiding potential issues with mixing strings and bytes.

The refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original bash script but presents it in a more robust and maintainable format. However, it still relies on external tools like xclip and kdialog, which may need to be installed separately.

To further improve the script, you could consider:
- Adding error handling for subprocess calls
- Implementing a command-line interface for more flexible usage
- Using a more cross-platform clipboard library instead of xclip
- Replacing kdialog with a more universal notification method
