The refactored code includes several improvements:

1. Type hints: Added type hints to improve code readability and catch potential type-related errors.

2. Code organization: Split the `toggle_monitoring` method into smaller, more focused methods (`_stop_monitoring`, `_start_monitoring`, `_get_paper_title`, `_setup_output`).

3. Improved naming: Renamed `_start_clipboard_monitoring` to `_start_clipboard_monitoring_thread` for clarity.

4. Simplified logic: Moved the clipboard content processing into a separate method `_process_new_content`.

5. Consistency: Used f-strings consistently throughout the code.

6. Error handling: Changed `exit(1)` to `sys.exit(1)` for better consistency with Python's standard library.

7. Reduced duplication: Consolidated repeated code into separate methods.

8. Improved readability: Broke down long lines and complex conditions into more readable chunks.

9. Constants: Although not present in this particular code, consider using constants for magic strings or numbers if they appear multiple times in the code.

These changes make the code more maintainable, easier to read, and less prone to errors. The functionality remains the same, but the structure is cleaner and more modular.
