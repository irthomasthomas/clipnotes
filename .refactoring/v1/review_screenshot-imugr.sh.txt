The refactored code includes the following improvements:

1. Added the correct shebang line: The shebang line now uses `#!/bin/bash` instead of `!#/bin/bash`, which is the proper format for bash scripts.

2. Created a function: The alert sound functionality is now encapsulated in a function called `play_alert_sound()`. This improves code organization and makes it easier to reuse or modify the alert sound in the future.

3. Used a local variable: The message string is now stored in a local variable within the function, which is a good practice for avoiding naming conflicts and improving script maintainability.

4. Improved comments: The comment now accurately describes the purpose of the script, which is to play an alert sound.

5. Called the function: The script now explicitly calls the `play_alert_sound()` function to execute the alert.

These changes make the script more organized, maintainable, and easier to understand. The functionality remains the same, but the code structure is improved.
