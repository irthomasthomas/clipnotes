The given code implements a Selection Stitcher program that monitors clipboard changes and combines two consecutive selections. It also includes unit tests for the functionality. The code is generally well-structured but can be improved in terms of simplicity and reducing imports. Here are some observations:

1. The code mixes the main functionality with testing in a single file.
2. It uses multiple imports that can be reduced or eliminated.
3. The notification system using tkinter might be overkill for a simple clipboard utility.
4. The main loop in the `run` method could be simplified.
5. The unittest part can be separated or removed if not needed in the main program.

In the refactored version, I'll focus on simplifying the code, reducing imports, and merging the functionality into a single Python file without the test suite.
