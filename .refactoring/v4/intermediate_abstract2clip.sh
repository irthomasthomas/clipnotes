Here's my analysis and refactored code:

<REVIEW>
The provided code is a combination of Python and Bash scripts. It aims to fetch text from the primary selection (likely on a Linux system), generate an abstract from this text, and then copy the abstract to the clipboard. The code is well-structured but can be improved by:

1. Merging the functionality into a single Python file.
2. Removing the dependency on external bash commands where possible.
3. Implementing a more robust abstract generation function.
4. Improving error handling and user feedback.
5. Reducing the number of imports.

The refactored code addresses these points while maintaining the core functionality.

<REFACTORED_CODE>
import subprocess
import pyperclip

def get_primary_selection():
    try:
        return subprocess.check_output(['xclip', '-o', '-selection', 'primary'], stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL).decode('utf-8').strip()
    except (subprocess.CalledProcessError, FileNotFoundError):
        print("Error: Unable to get primary selection. Make sure xclip is installed.")
        return ""

def generate_abstract(text, max_words=30):
    words = text.split()
    if len(words) > max_words:
        abstract = ' '.join(words[:max_words]) + '...'
    else:
        abstract = text
    return f"Abstract: {abstract}"

def main():
    # Get text from primary selection
    primary_text = get_primary_selection()
    
    if not primary_text:
        print("No text in primary selection. Exiting.")
        return
    
    # Generate abstract
    abstract = generate_abstract(primary_text)
    
    # Copy abstract to clipboard
    try:
        pyperclip.copy(abstract)
        print("Abstract generated and copied to clipboard:")
        print(abstract)
    except pyperclip.PyperclipException:
        print("Error: Unable to copy to clipboard. Is a clipboard manager running?")
        print("Generated abstract:")
        print(abstract)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</REFACTORED_CODE>

The refactored code makes the following improvements:

1. Merged all functionality into a single Python file.
2. Removed the shutil import and simplified the xclip check.
3. Implemented a simple but functional abstract generation method.
4. Improved error handling and user feedback.
5. Reduced the number of imports to just subprocess and pyperclip.
6. Removed the placeholder fetch_abstract function and replaced it with a real generate_abstract function.
7. Simplified the main function flow.

This refactored version maintains the core functionality while being more concise and robust. It still relies on xclip for getting the primary selection, as this is typically the most reliable method on Linux systems. The abstract generation is now done within Python, eliminating the need for any external bash scripts.
