<REVIEW>
The provided code is a Python script that combines functionality to interact with the clipboard, create a simple GUI for user input, and format the data in XML. It's a good start, but there are a few improvements we can make to enhance its efficiency and readability. 

Key observations:
1. The script is already in Python, so there's no need to merge multiple files.
2. The imports can be optimized to reduce the number of dependencies.
3. The XML creation process can be simplified.
4. Error handling can be improved.
5. The code structure can be enhanced for better readability and maintainability.

import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import simpledialog

from xml.etree.ElementTree import Element, tostring

def get_clipboard_content():
    return pyperclip.paste()

        question = create_xml_element("reader_note", ask_question(root))
        
        result = f"{subject}\n{question}"
        pyperclip.copy(result)
        print("Result copied to clipboard:")
        print(result)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

    main()
</REFACTORED_CODE>

The refactored code includes the following improvements:

1. Simplified imports by using `from xml.etree.ElementTree import Element, tostring` instead of importing the entire module.
2. Renamed functions for clarity (e.g., `get_selection()` to `get_clipboard_content()`).
3. Moved the creation of the `tk.Tk()` root window to the `main()` function for better control over its lifecycle.
4. Simplified the XML creation process by directly using `Element` and `tostring`.
5. Added basic error handling with a try-except block in the `main()` function.
6. Ensured the root window is properly destroyed after use.
7. Improved code structure and naming conventions for better readability.

These changes make the code more efficient, easier to read, and more robust while maintaining all the original functionality.
