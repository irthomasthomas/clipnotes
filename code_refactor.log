2024-08-02 21:52:46,178 - __main__ - INFO - Final review:
I have merged the strengths of both scripts into a new Python script. The merged code:
    1. Retains the user interaction and query input method from the bash script.
    2. Uses the language model to search for papers and generate initial results.
    3. Utilizes concurrent abstract fetching to verify and potentially enhance the abstracts.
    4. Improves error handling and logging.
    5. Is more modular and easier to maintain.

    The merge is complete and the resulting code should be fully functional. However, there are a few areas that could be improved or expanded:
    1. The `shot-scraper` functionality is included but not fully integrated. It could be used to verify or enhance the abstracts obtained from the language model.
    2. Error handling could be further improved, especially for network-related issues.
    3. The code could benefit from more comprehensive logging.
    4. Unit tests should be added to ensure the reliability of each function.
